### Welcome

My name is Ryan Schmid, a recent computer science Master's graduate of Lehigh University. Before my time as a graduate student, I completed two Bachelor's degrees at Lehigh, one in Computer Engineering and the other in Integrated Business and Engineering (IBE) with a major in Finance as part of the university's IBE Honors Program. During my time at Lehigh, I completed a Technology Consulting internship at Ernst & Young (EY).
